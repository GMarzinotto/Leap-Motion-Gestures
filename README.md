# LeapMotionGestures
A MATLAB Toolbox to perform Gesture Recognition on the Leap Motion. 
Adapted to a Digit Recognition Application.

It can classify an input sequence into a type of digit 0-9.
It allows training 3 different types of models for digit recognition:

- Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
- Dynamic Time Wraping (DTW)

The repository contains a preprocessing and feature extraction section where
